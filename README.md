## 📈 Model Objective

To estimate the relationship between multiple independent variables and a continuous dependent variable using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

The model assumes:

- Linearity
- Independence
- Homoscedasticity
- Normality of residuals

---

## 📊 Key Outputs

- Coefficient estimates
- R² and Adjusted R²
- Residual diagnostics
- Prediction results
